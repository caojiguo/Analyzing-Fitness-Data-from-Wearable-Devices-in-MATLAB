<p>Collecting and tracking health and fitness data with smartphones and wearable devices is about to go mainstream as the internet giants like Apple, Google and Samsung jumping into the fray. But if you collect data, what's the point if you don't analyze it!</p>

<p>I would like to use a publicly available dataset about weight lifting and pretend that we are going to build a mobile app to advise end users whether they are performing the exercise correctly, and if not, which common mistakes they are making. We will use machine learning/predictive modeling technique called 'Random Forest' popularized by Kaggle competitions to detect user activity patterns.</p>

<p><a href="http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har">Human Activity Recognition (HAR)</a> Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset provides measurements to determine "how well an activity was performed". 6 subjects performed 1 set of 10 Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in 5 different ways.</p>

<ol>
<li>exactly according to the specification (Class A)</li>
<li>throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)</li>
<li>lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)</li>
<li>lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)</li>
<li>throwing the hips to the front (Class E)</li>
</ol><p>All together 39,242 samples with 159 variables are available in the original dataset, but we will use a reduced subset of 19,622 samples.</p>

<p>Sensors were placed on the subjects' belts, armbands, glove and dumbbells, as described below:</p>

<p>One of the key techniques you use in predictive modeling or machine learning is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_%28statistics%29">cross validation</a>. Roughly speaking, you hold out part of available data for testing later, and build models using the remaining dataset. The held out set is called 'test set' and the set we will use for modeling is called 'training set'. This makes it more difficult to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">overfit</a> your model, because you can test your model against the data you didn't use in the modeling process.</p>

<pre><code>% Set the random number seed to make the results repeatable
rng('default');

% Partition the dataset to a 80:20 split
cv = cvpartition(height(T),'holdout',0.20);

% Training set
Xtrain = T(training(cv),:);
Ytrain = class(training(cv));
fprintf('\nTraining Set\n')
tabulate(Ytrain)

<p>Raw data is never clean, so you need to check for missing values and transform data into usable form. If the range of values differ substantially from one variable to another, it can affect the machine learning algorithms. Therefore we normalize the data as well.</p>

% too many values missing for those variables to be useful
% dropping vars with missing values

<p>You begin exploratory data analysis by plotting the variables in order to get oriented with the dataset. Plots of the first four variables show that:</p>

<ol>
<li>data is sorted by class - requires random reshuffling.</li>
<li>data points cluster around a few different mean values - indicating that measurements were taken by devices calibrated in a few different ways. The following plot shows the first variable by users, and it is clear that one group used one calibration and another group used a different one.</li>
<li>those variables exhibit a distinct patterns for Class E (colored in magenta) - those variables will be useful to isolate it.</li>

<a name="predictive-modeling-with-random-forest" class="anchor" href="#predictive-modeling-with-random-forest"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Predictive Modeling with Random Forest</h2>

<p>The dataset has a bit of issues with calibration. We could further preprocess the data in order to remove calibration gaps. This time, however, I would like to use the dataset as is and use a highly flexible algorithm called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forest</a>. In MATLAB, this algorithm is implemented in <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/treebagger.html">TreeBagger</a> class available in <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics/">Statistics Toolbox</a>.</p>

<p>Random Forest became popular particularly after it was used by number of winners in <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle competitions</a>. It uses a large ensemble of decision trees (thus 'forest') trained on random subsets of data and uses majority votes of those trees to predict the result. It tends to produce a highly accurate result, but the complexity of the algorithm makes it slow and difficult to interpret.</p>

<p>To accelerate the computation, I will enable parallel option supported on <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing/">Parallel Computing Toolbox</a>. You can comment out unnecessary code if you don't use it.</p>

<p>Once the model is built, you will see the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/confusionmat.html">confusion matrix</a> that compares the actual class labels to predicted class labels. If everything line up on a diagonal line, then you got 100% accuracy. Off-diagonal numbers are misclassification errors.</p>

<p>The model has a very high prediction accuracy even though we saw earlier that our dataset was not as problem free as we would like.</p>

<pre><code>% initialize parallel option - comment out if you don't use parallel
poolobj = gcp('nocreate'); % don't create a new pool even if no pool exits
if isempty(poolobj)
    parpool('local',2)
end
opts = statset('UseParallel',true);

% reshuffle the dataset
randidx = randperm(height(Xtrain));
Xtrain = Xtrain(randidx,:);
Ytrain = Ytrain(randidx);

% create a random forest model with 100 trees, parallel enabled...
rfmodel = TreeBagger(100,table2array(Xtrain),Ytrain,'options',opts,...
    'Method','classification','oobvarimp','on');
% non-parallel version of the same model
% rfmodel = TreeBagger(100,table2array(Xtrain),Ytrain,...
%     'Method','classification','oobpre','on','oobvarimp','on');

% predict the class labels for test set
[Ypred,Yscore]= predict(rfmodel,table2array(Xtest));

% compute the confusion matrix and prediction accuracy
C = confusionmat(Ytest,categorical(Ypred));
disp(array2table(C,'VariableNames',rfmodel.ClassNames,'RowNames',rfmodel.ClassNames))
fprintf('Prediction accuracy on test set: %f\n\n', sum(C(logical(eye(5))))/sum(sum(C)))

<p>I happened to pick 100 trees in the model, but you can check the misclassification errors relative to the number of trees used in prediction. The plot shows that 100 is an overkill - we could use fewer trees and that will make it go faster.</p>

<a name="variable-importance" class="anchor" href="#variable-importance"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Variable Importance</h2>

<p>One major criticism of Random Forest is that it is a black box algorithm and not easy to understand what it is doing. However, Random Forest can provide variable importance measure, which corresponds to the change in prediction error with and without the presence of a given variable in the model.</p>

<p>For our hypothetical weight lifting trainer mobile app, Random Forest would be too cumbersome and slow to implement, so you want to use a simpler prediction model with fewer predictor variables. Random Forest can help you with selecting which predictors you can drop without sacrificing the prediction accuracy too much.</p>

<p>Let's see how you can do this with TreeBagger.</p>

<pre><code>% get the variable importance scores and sort it. 
vars = Xtrain.Properties.VariableNames;
% because we turned 'oobvarimp' to 'on', the model contains 
% OOBPermutedVarDeltaError that acts as variable importance measure
varimp = rfmodel.OOBPermutedVarDeltaError';
[~,idxvarimp]= sort(varimp);
labels = vars(idxvarimp);

% plot the sorted scores

<a name="evaluate-trade-off-with-roc-plot" class="anchor" href="#evaluate-trade-off-with-roc-plot"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Evaluate trade-off with ROC plot</h2>

<p>Now let's do the trade-off between the number of predictor variables and prediction accuracy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic">Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)</a> plot provides a convenient way to visualize and compare performance of binary classifiers. You plot false positive rate against true positive rate at various prediction threshold to produce the curves. If you get completely random result, the curve should follow a diagonal line. If you get a 100% accuracy, then the curve should hug the upper left corner. This means you can use the area under curve (AUC) to evaluate how well each model performs.</p>

<p>Let's plot ROC curves with different set of predictor variables, using "C" class as the positive class, since we can only do this one class at a time, and the previous confusion matrix shows more misclassification errors for this class than others. You can use <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/perfcurve.html">perfcurve</a> to compute ROC curves.</p>

<pre><code>% sort variable importance scores in a descending order

<p>Based on the previous analysis, it looks like you can achieve high accuracy rate even if you use as few as 10 features. Let's say we settled for 12 features. We now know you don't have to use the data from the glove for prediction, so that's one less sensor our hypothetical end users would have to buy. Given this result, I may even consider dropping the arm band, and just stick with the belt and dumbbell sensors.</p>

<p>Despite my initial misgivings about the data, we were able to maintain high prediction accuracy with Random Forest model with just 12 features. However, Random Forest is probably not an ideal model to implement on a mobile app given its memory foot print and slow response time.</p>

<p>The next step is to find a simpler models, such as <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/mnrfit.html">logistics regression</a>, that can perform decently. You may need to do more preprocessing of the data to make it work.</p>

<p>Finally, I have never tried this before, but you could generate C code out of MATLAB to incorporate it into an iPhone app. Watch this webinar <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/videos/matlab-to-iphone-made-easy-90834.html">MATLAB to iPhone Made Easy</a> for more details. I believe there will be an Android version of this webinar eventually.</p>
